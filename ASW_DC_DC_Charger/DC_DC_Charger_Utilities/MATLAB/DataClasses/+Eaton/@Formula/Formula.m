%Eaton.Formula  Class definition.

  % NOTE:
  % This class was originally defined in the Simulink data class designer
  % but it is not a subclass of a Simulink data class.  As a result, the
  % upgraded class cannot support the specification of property types.

  % Property type from data class designer: 'string'
  properties % (PropertyType = 'char')
    Description = 'Description';
    DocUnits = 'None';
    Formulae = 'X1';
  end
